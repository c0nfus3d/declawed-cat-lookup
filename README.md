### Abstract

I am considering adopting a cat, and currently looking around the Baton Rouge, Louisiana area. [Cat Haven](https://cathaven.org) was the first one I came across and looks quite reputable, so I started my search.

After considering my options, I realized a declawed cat would be ideal; [don't worry Peta](http://www.peta.org/living/companion-animals/8-reasons-never-declaw-cats/), I am not going to force that procedure on an animal. However, if a cat is currently up for adoption that was previously declawed, I would welcome the cat in to my indoor, furever home.

Using my [full-stack dev[eloper]](http://codeup.com/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/) skills, I quickly built a [Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) application to search in detail for me.

    npm install && npm start

Running the node application lists the cat with their current `Declawed` status

    Patches - No
    Zoomy - No
    Scout - No
    Olive - No
    Princess - No
    Tiny - No
    Dorian - No
    ...

It eventually times out, and I am stopping development there.. what have I done??
